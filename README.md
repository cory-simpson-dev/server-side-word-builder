# Server-side Word Builder

Full-stack application using HTML, CSS (grid), JS, and node.js.

Client-side has access to a few options to build words:

    1. Fetching a random assortment of characters (consonants, vowels, punctuation)
    2. Saving built word to localStorage
    3. Toggling previously saved words
